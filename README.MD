Cave_Game is a simple project I've imported from Python course I'm following on Udemy.
https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/

There have been some modifications made, such as:
1. Ability to restart the game
2. Finding yourself in a different location every itteration

I've really enjoyed this project and would recommend to anyone to repeat it themselves too, creating a form of D&D game that users can play.
